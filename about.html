            <h2>Welcome to the Counting Sequence Game!</h2>
            <p>
                Our game is designed to help young children practice counting 
                in a fun and engaging way. Counting is a fundamental skill 
                that lays the groundwork for future math concepts. Through 
                interactive gameplay, children will learn to count from 1 to 5 
                while enjoying colorful graphics and exciting challenges.

                Our game incorporates bright colors and friendly characters 
                to keep little ones motivated and excited about counting. 
                Every time a child plays, they enhance their numerical skills 
                and build confidence in their abilities.
